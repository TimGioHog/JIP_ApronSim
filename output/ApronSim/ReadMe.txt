Screen resolution must be at least 1920x 1080p, lower resolutions are currently not supported.
When using a 1920x1080p screen, the scaling (see display settings) must be set to 100%!

Accuracy of the vehicle movement is dependent on the simulation speed. 
Therefore, having a speed higher than 32x is currently not recommended, and might break the simulation.

Adding/removing delays from tasks after they are finished has no effect
